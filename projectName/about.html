        <h1>About this Page</h1>
        <img id="imgfleft" src="img/me.png" style="width:27%"> My overall idea is about washing a spoon without splashing yourself. The interactive website takes you on a journey on the different paths of the most stressful to the less stressful start to your day while having to wash your spoon in the morning. Depending on the character you choose, the obstacle will vary. Chad is the typical first year that loves getting drunk a little too much and because he goes to a party the night before his 9 am start at work, he has put himself in a state that isn’t the greatest for the next morning. That's why his paths end up in either, being late to work, hungry or wet from the spoon. All not good. Though Lily is the complete opposite. All her paths are very reasonable. All her outcomes are very positive, always at work on time and successfully cleaning a spoon.</p>
        <p>My goal with this interactive website is to take the user on an adventure and understand the situation that everyone can be in. The reason why I made this design like this is that the goal of this “pick your path” game is to clean a spoon successfully, which is a very nesh/ semi silly concept. So the website can’t look too professional or serious. I was aiming for a fun and cute game.</p>
        <p>I decide to code this website because I already know how to code and it was a little easier for me. I also knew if I did use one of those DIY webpage platforms I knew I would get too confusing because of how easy it would be. By coding my own website I knew what page link to what, what the page is called, everything would be more engraved in my brain.</p>
        <p>Overall I didn’t get too confused which is a very big bonus and really enjoyed doing this. Next time I maybe can work on a few more paths and making it a little more clear it’s about washing a spoon.</p>
